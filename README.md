# AUTOMATED-MANUAL-TRANSMISSION-kit-fabrication

## AIM:

The main difficulty of riding a geared bike is controlling the clutch on offroad 
rides and traffic. This concept is to overcome the above mentioned difficulty 
by automating the clutch control and to make it easy for women, physically challenged people to ride. This project is based on the concept of Automated 
Manual Clutch Control (by Actuator and Quick shifter). In this system, 
automated clutch control reduces the driverâ€™s effort to drive the two-wheeler,
with more conscious towards controlling the clutch in traffic, off road rides etc.

In this system the clutch is controlled by a microcontroller (PIC 16F877A) 
automatically in accordance with gear shifting mechanism, either it maybe 
automatic or manual. The system is a kit which can be implemented in existing 
manually controlled two-wheeler vehicles. It comes with idea to make the 
driving easy in traffic situation and to encourage physically challenged and 
amputated people to ride bike without any difficult of handling clutch. The 
actuator used here is DC motor of 45rpm, and quick up-shifting technology was implemented to eliminate the knocking sound in gear box. 
This system is successfully implemented on an existing manually controlled vehicle for testing. The actuators are controlled by a micro controller circuit, this circuit guides the actuators taking into consideration the speed of the vehicle and initial throttle position.
